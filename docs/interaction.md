# Interactions

In general, `rose` support local, complex interactions. While we expect that
most users will take advantage of the hard-coded Koning-Delaroche potential, we
have always written `rose` with the expectation that many users will want to
define their own interactions. The classes below make that process more
convenient.

## Koning-Delaroche

::: rose.koning_delaroche

## Affine, Fixed-Energy Interactions

::: rose.interaction

## Non-Affine, Fixed-Energy Interactions

::: rose.interaction_eim

## Non-Affine, Energy-Emulated Interactions

::: rose.energized_interaction_eim

## Spin-Orbit

::: rose.spin_orbit
