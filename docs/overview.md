## `ReducedBasisEmulator`

The `ReducedBasisEmulator` class is the primary object. To create an instance,
one needs minimally an `Interaction`, a set of training points, an energy, and
an angular momentum.

## `Interaction`

The `Interaction` class represents the local, 2-body potential that
characterizes the physics of the problem.
