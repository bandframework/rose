    "# Building and Optimizing an Emulator\n",

    "Let's build an emulator for a quantum scattering problem with an optical potential! We will choose neutron scattering on the $^{40}$ Ca nucleus as our test problem. In particular, we want to build an emulator that can predict the differential elastic scattering cross section for this reaction, at a given energy as quickly and accurately as possible. \n",

    "We have the following Hamiltonian as the radial part of the scattering equation:\n",

    "where a system with reduced mass $\\mu$ interacts through a potential $V(r,\\alpha)=U(r,\\alpha)/2\\mu$ with parameters $\\alpha$, $\\ell$ is the angular momentum quantum number, and $p$ is the asymptotic linear momentum. In the code implementation we re-scale the equation to work in dimensionless units $s=rp$. Our reduced basis expansion of $n$ basis can be written as:\n",

For a video and other notebook resources on ROSE [check this link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1223721/contributions/5394829/). The full derivation of the involved equations, both for the high fidelity and the reduced basis counter part, will be presented in an upcoming publication and linked here.\n",

To do this, we will use a high-fidelity (HF) solver to construct a basis of solutions as we perturb $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ around our region of interest, and then construct a suitable reduced basis emulator from it. \n",

To be more precise, we can't factorize this function into the product of functions of just the parameters $R$ and $a$, and another function of just the domain of the problem $r$. A mathematician would say that this operator is not \"affine\" in the geometric parameters. To handle emulating the potential operator, we will need to construct an approximation that is factorizable using something called the Empirical Interplation Method (EIM). Chapters 2 and 3 of [this book](https://dr.ascsn.net/) contain a more detail view (within a nuclear physics context) of the reduced basis method and the empirical interpolation method we use in ROSE. \n",

    "Great, now we can decide empirically which emulator configuration is the fastest for a given accuracy, and we can quantitatively see that the emulators are categorically superior to the HF solver when it comes to getting fast and accurate differential cross sections. The dashed black lines represent an (arbitrary) target for speed and accuracy: more than 1 million samples per hour and less than 0.1 median absolute error. Options (7,7) and (10,10) for the emulator fullfil both of these requirements, while none of the high fidelity solvers get near the target region.\n",

We would expect diminishing returns for more EIM terms, however, and if the error is dominated by a lack of enough wave function basis (as the case of the (3,5) emulator) then increasing the EIM terms will not improve the emulator at all. For basis size, since ROSE has to actually solve a system of equations proportional to this variable, we except the time to scale roughly with the square of the basis size, so the impact on time is much larger. Since we only trained with 50 samples, in this case increasing te basis number further will saturate the median error in around 10^-4, but further improvement can be done by providing more training points for ROSE.\n",
